Course - Python for AI

AI, ML, Data Science --> Buzz words
90% students fail to explain these terms.
We will get to know what these terms are?

About Course --> Calender --> Certification

AI/ML?
What ?
Are they same?

AI --> Artificial Intelligence
Something which is intelligence is able to see the patterns.
We humans are originally intelligent. At the same time we are lazy.
What if we try give intelligence to computers?
Computers are dumb.
When we train these computer so that these computer start taking decisions, observing patterns like humans.
It is called Artificial Intelligence.

Examples of AI --> Alexa, Siri, GoogleHome

Basically, we are trying to make computers think like humans, making the machine smarter.
This is AI.

ML? --> Machine Learning
What is ML?
ML is the process of teaching machines to get better.

Example --> "Span Email Filter" gets better after some time.
Example --> "Auto-Correct"

Example of AI/ML: "Smart Traffic Management System" instead of traffic cop/police.
ML increases the performance og AI.
ML-Teacher & AI-Child in Playschool
ML is subset of AI.

Data Scientist?/Data Analyst?

Data Science? --> Future
Domain Expertise + Data Access + Statistical method= used to make predictions
Data Science is about Future.

Data Analytics? --> Present
Take the current Data --> Analyse and create a report on present situation
Ex.. Data Acience tells "How the company is performing right now?"

These days, data is created in huge amount
You need to deal with huge amount of data.
Therefore, a system is needed to deal with this large amount of data.

A common language that we use to talk to computer is "PYTHON"
Python + Python Libraries --> Important

In this course:
Python
OOP
DataBases : Mysql, Momgodb
Flask
Libraries --> Panda, Numpy
Projects --> Swiggy(Analysing things)

In next 4 weeks, we will cover these entire topics.

Why only Python for AI?
Because Python is Sweet language
Python is Easy language
Most of the resources are available in Python as most people are using this.
